resemblance
===========

Resemblance is personal project I've created to help me mantain my Ubuntu's configurations/customizations versioned. It was brought into existence so that I can keep multiple machines (with the same distro) in partial sync, and so that I can easily reinstall everything up from scratch.

I also did this for fun: Be aware that I am no shell script wiz and that my (limited) knowledge in it was getting rusty, so I am sure there is plenty of room for improvements. For now, as the project is almost achieving my personal goals, it will not be very active, but if more people get interested I may put more time on it. If you want to get involved, just contact me. Any help is appretiated.
