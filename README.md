resemblance
===========

Resemblance is personal project I've created in order to help me mantain my Ubuntu's configurations/customizations versioned. It was brought into existence so that I could keep multiple machines (with the same distro) in partial sync, and so that I could also easily reinstall my OS up from scratch.

I also did this for fun: Be aware that I am no shell script wiz and that my (limited) knowledge in it was getting rusty, so I am sure there is plenty of room for improvements. For now, as the project is almost achieving my personal needs and goals. For now on it probably will not be very active, but if someone else get show some interest, I may put more time on it. Also, if you want to get involved, just contact me. Any help is appretiated.
